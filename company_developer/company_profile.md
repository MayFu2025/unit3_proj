### Closed Hiring! Marina has been hired for this project.

## Welcome to May's Coffee Shop!

### Problem
My company offers many different drinks. While this is what helped the shop gain so much popularity, it has become hard to manage. We have discovered that we need a way to be able to easily track our stock of materials and the revenue we make. As of now, all of this data is tracked manually on a notebook each day. This has started to get frustrating, and it has been concluded amongst the employees that a shared digital application would work the best for all. 

### Shop Details
The biggest thing that we offer in the shop is, obviously, coffee. May's Coffee Shop offers americanos to cappuccinos, lattes with every kind of milk possible, and seasonal offers. Below is a list of all of the ingredients the store holds stock of, and therefore needs to track.
- Coffee (ml)
- Water (ml)
- Milks: Cow milk, Soy milk, Almond milk, Oat milk (ml)
- Sauces: Chocolate, Caramel, Strawberry (g)
- Milk foam, Whipped cream, Ice cream (g)
- Sprinkles (g)

An example of a recipe for one of the most popular drinks offered is listed below. 

May's Original Latte, S size:
- coffee: 200ml
- milk: 100ml
- cost: $3.50

All drinks of the cafe can be expressed as different variations of this latte, such as by:
- Changing the type of milk (e.g. soy milk, almond milk)
- Changing the ratio of milk to coffee (which changes the menu name, see fig 1. below)
- Adding extra toppings (e.g. sauces, whipped cream, ice cream)
- Changing the cost (inflation is scary!)

### Minimum Requirements
Now that the shop has gained a stable customer count per day, if necessary, the shop can consider decreasing the total number of drinks available on the menu. However, the minimum different types of drinks we would like to offer, is 6. Here's an example of how even coffee, has many different variations:

We also offer 3 sizes, as any coffee shop should. These sizes are S, M, and L. The ratio for the amount of drink between the three sizes should be as follows. I would like that this can be accounted for in the program.
- M holds 1.25 times more liquid than its menu's S size.
- L holds 1.5 times more liquid than its menu's S size.
- The minimum amount of liquid a drink should have in its S size, is 300ml.

### Now Hiring
Ideally, I am looking for an developer who:
- Can propose a rough idea of how they will track shop resources and revenue before starting the project
- Can communicate with me when there are issues, or changes that need to be brought up with me
- Will try their best!
